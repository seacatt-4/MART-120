GUI, or graphical user interface, is an effective and convenient tool implemented in most devices. This tool allows for easier navigation, understanding, and typically has a more aesthetic and intuitive feel. This interface does have it's limitations, but when complimented with CLI, the device is entirely in your hands. CLI, command line interface, is most recognizable from Hollywood hackers. Though this green text is mysterious and confusing in movies, it's actually what you do every day, but with words instead of icons. In both interfaces, open, close, make, delete, and search, are quick and common actions. Where these two differ the most is in their capability and appearance. Strikingly noticeable, the lines upon lines of CLI text is not quite as pretty as customized wallpapers and widgets with shortcuts on GUI. That said, CLI offers you access into customizations behind the scenes, advanced changes and creations. This is the GUI's shortcoming, the streamlined interaction comes at the cost of structural understanding and unobstructed access. CLI is incredibly useful for those that take the time to learn it, but the GUI will always stand by when you're ready for ease.
