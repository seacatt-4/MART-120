	Learning styles are typically described as auditory, visual, physical, or verbal. I find I learn best hands-on, the physical learning style. If I interact directly with the materials or help build something, it's like my whole body remembers rather than just my ears. Auditory is the most difficult for me to process, it starts to feel like mumbled jargon and background noise. Solving problems, trying new techniques, and teaching other people are all actions that solidify that knowledge in my mind. The physical learning style allows me to make a mistake and fix it real time, this way I experience the knowledge, and I feel it's the most natural way that I grow and improve.
