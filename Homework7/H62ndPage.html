		<p>Well, maybe I lied and this is two dreams. First, I'll introduce you to two important character: A and T. A is T's little sister, and they were my neighbors at the time. T was dating a kind girl and had just moved away. 
			<br />
	The first dream starts as I'm walking into A and T's house, as I walk in, I'm actually entering my house's kitchen. I see A looking stressed and I ask what's wrong, she speaks with urgency, "I don't know what to do! I was in town and saw T's girlfriend kissing another guy at a cafe! This is terrible, how do I tell him? Obviously I have to but this is so bad." Shocked and concerned, I ask her questions and help her calm down so we can find the best path forward. The dream ends here, short, but dense. I wake confused, and brush it off.
	<br />
	The second dream comes around just a few weeks later, it starts completely unrelated in a strange, not-3-dimensional world. I am walking along strings of neon light that stretch out in directions that shouldn't exist, suspended in endless space and distant stars. It really was quite beautiful. I had a vague understanding that these lines had something to do with life paths or possible realities, condensed into a streak of color. As I walked, I saw my mother wandering a line with A and T's mother up and away, occasionally concealed by folded space. I see T, and head toward him, walking along a line that sways from pink to magenta, and we talk. I notice that he shaved his head, a hairstyle I'd never seen or expected him to have. We sit on this pink stretch of light, dangling our legs over nothing and staring into starry skies. He asks about home and school, I ask about firefighting and college. The previous dream jumps into my memory, and I wonder if we told him what happened yet. I ask about his girlfriend. He looks down, and then away, "Well, we broke up. I found out she'd been cheating," I tell him I'm sorry to hear that, and ask how he's doing, "I'm alright, it ended and that's kind of it."
	The dream continued with a bit more conversation and then drifted into another bizzare story. When I woke this time, I was really confused. Two dreams about his girlfriend cheating? She's really sweet and I hope it's not true, but I haven't seen him or her in a while, so I have no place to make judgement, and I move on.
	Where this gets weird is when he snapped me back one day. And he had shaved his head. I remember my dream. I ask about firefighting, school, and his girlfriend. He responds, that he's alright, and that they broke up.
	<br />
	As far as I know, there was no cheating involved, but it was a strange succession of events in a beautiful setting.
